        Automotive aerodynamics is the study of the aerodynamics of road
        vehicles. Its main goals are reducing drag and wind noise, minimizing
        noise emission, and preventing undesired lift forces and other causes of
        aerodynamic instability at high speeds. Air is also considered a fluid
        in this case.

        Vanes and fins direct some of the air around the car to the tire vents
        and increase the downforce on the car. The hump and diffuser channel the
        air under the car. This creates an area of low pressure, increasing the
        downforce and stability of the vehicle
